=============================== Prelab =======================================

Pixel                |    RGB Value     |  Distance from Chroma Key
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Top-left background  | (   ,    ,    )  |  n/a
Arm                  | (   ,    ,    )  |
Vest                 | (   ,    ,    )  |
Shirt                | (   ,    ,    )  |

================================== Review ===================================
1. Discuss and justify which pixels you chose to compute the average 
background value for method 1. Was there a reason not to choose more or
fewer pixels?

Response 1:

2. For method 1, do some experiments to find the range of distance thresholds 
for which the program seems to operate the best. You may use different 
thresholds for the two different sample images (Colbert and Bird). 
Note: threshold values that are too low will cause certain portions of the 
chroma key to stay in the picture; values that are too high will cause parts 
of the foreground image to disappear.

Response 2:

  Image                  Min Threshold           Max Threshold
  Colbert range:  from                   to
  Bird range:     from                   to 


3. For method 2, explain what you implemented and why.  How did you go about 
implementing it? Walk us through a high-level description of what you did in 
your code (and use comments in the actual .cpp file to fill in the details). 
What other alternatives did you consider either before or after you
implemented your selected method?  What are the relative pros and cons of 
these methods? [This question is open-ended!]
